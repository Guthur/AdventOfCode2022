* Prolog

All the code has been run against multiple Prolog implementation with
the goal of producing code that is at least somewhat portable.

The selection of implementation was purely on the convenience of
package availability and should not be taken as endorsement or
admonishment against any particular implementation.

** Implementations
- GNU Prolog version 1.4.5
- SWI-Prolog version 8.4.2
